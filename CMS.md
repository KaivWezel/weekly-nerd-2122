# Content management systems (CMS)

So you probably already know what a CMS is, now all you have to do is choose one and start using it right? Well, the world of CMSs is pretty big and has a lot of options, you could even make your own custom CMS if you want to in your spare time.

## What is a Content Management System? 
So, short overview of what a Content Management System is:

### Content separated from design
A content management system is an application that helps you put your content on your website. It separates the content from the design, meaning your content can be edited at all times without messing up your site for the most part. Though, your site has to have some content, cause an empty site wil also look weird.

It does this by using templates. Templates are basically HTML files but with slots for data so your content can be loaded into these slots and be displayed on your website. Some content management systems allow you to edit these templates in a visual way. Wordpress for example let's you edit themes in their editor. You can adjust colours, sizes and layouts as a whole. This way you give the end user control of how their website is going to look.

All the data will be stored on a database and retrieved if any request to that data is made. Usually the data is structured in pages and documents/articles. You can create pages and their layout and then show content of the articles on the pages, and re-use those articles.

### headless
Where a traditional CMS gives a user control of the look and layout of the website, a headless CMS removes all those possibilities and only focusses on the management of content. A headless CMS only contains data/content that is served to a front-end where the templates are predefined and written by a designer/developer. Headless content management systems remove the complexity of creating your own website and layout with themes and let's you create your sites content without worrying about how it looks. At least, that is what it could do, some people want the possibility to edit their pages layout and colours.


## Why would I choose a CMS?
As the name suggests, you can manage content with the application. So they are most useful when implemented in sites where the content is edited a lot and the structure of the site is pretty predictable and consistent. They are easy to setup as long as you know how and you can have a site running in less than a day. Most of them have great support and a lot of options to expand your site. Think of webshops, blogs, live-data displays etc.

As a developer/designer, a CMS is a great selling-point to customers as they will be able to maintain their sites content without your help. You maybe have some explaining to do but the rest is theirs. 

But if you are a really good designer and you designed a pixel perfect website, won't the client be able to mess things up? That is where a headless CMS comes in. Since you can only edit content in a headless CMS, the appearance will pretty much alway be the same. You can give the user some customisation options but they are limited to what you as the developer have programmed it to do. This way your design stands as it is and won't be 'improved' by the client's vision of design.

## Which one do I choose?
So one thing I learned during my search for a CMS, there are a lot of options which all have something in favour. If you want to setup some quick sites that are easily maintainable by the client and you don't want to look after them, then a traditional CMS is probably the best way to go. After you have prepared the environment, the client can pretty much create their own website without help. 

If you are working on a more sophisticated project with a design, then a headless CMS is the way to go. Don't get the client involved with the design and let the just do the content. You will probably get a better designed site than if they just go ahead and select a Wordpress theme.

But, most important, it is also personal preference, especially since there are so many choices. So just play around with some of them and you'll find your way through the world of CMS's.
